# MVP Pricing Strategy

This document outlines a proposed pricing strategy for the initial launch (MVP) of the Asset Management System. The goal is to start with a simple, easy-to-understand structure that encourages adoption while providing a clear path for monetization and future expansion.

## Guiding Principles for MVP

1.  **Simplicity:** Avoid complex tiers initially. Make it easy for early adopters to choose a plan.
2.  **Product-Led Growth (PLG):** A free tier is crucial to let users experience the core value of the product without friction.
3.  **Validate Core Value:** The initial paid plan should focus on the core asset management features. The advanced, unique features (like AI-powered CO2 reporting) can be reserved for a higher-touch sales process or a future premium tier.
4.  **Flexibility:** The "Contact Us" model for larger needs allows us to learn from high-value early customers and tailor solutions for them.

## Future Roadmap

This MVP structure is designed to evolve. As the product matures and we gather customer feedback, we can expand this into a more granular, multi-tiered model, potentially splitting the "Pro" plan and creating a dedicated "Business" tier for the automation features, while firmly establishing the AI features in a top-tier "Enterprise" plan.
