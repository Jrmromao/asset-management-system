- **Status Cards**: Real-time metrics and statistics
- **Import Functionality**: CSV import with validation

**Backend Actions**
```typescript
// lib/actions/accessory.actions.ts
✅ insert() - Create new accessories with stock tracking
✅ getAll() - Fetch all accessories with relations
✅ findById() - Get detailed accessory with audit logs
✅ update() - Update accessory properties
✅ remove() - Delete with proper cleanup
```

**Advanced Features**
- Stock movement tracking
- Reorder point alerts
- Assignment/checkout system
- Audit trail logging
- Company data isolation
- File upload and import

#### ⚠️ Minor Gaps (15%)

**Backend Enhancements Needed**
- Complete implementation of assignment logic
- Enhanced error handling in some actions
- Export functionality improvements

**UI Polish**

- Enhanced reporting views

### Licenses Module Analysis

#### ✅ Completed Features

**Database Schema**
- Comprehensive License model with all required fields
- `LicenseSeat` table for seat allocation tracking
- `UserItem` integration for assignments
- Renewal and compliance tracking fields

**Frontend Implementation**
- **Main Page**: `/licenses` - Complete listing interface
- **Create Page**: `/licenses/create` - Professional form with validation
- **Detail View**: `/licenses/view/[id]` - Detailed license information
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive schemas with business rules
- **UI Components**: Status cards, data tables, responsive design

**Schema Validation**
```typescript
// lib/schemas/index.ts
✅ licenseSchema - Complete validation rules
✅ Business logic validation (seats > minSeatsAlert)
✅ Required field validation
✅ Type safety with TypeScript
```

#### ⚠️ Implementation Gaps (35%)

**Backend Actions - Critical**
```typescript
// lib/actions/license.actions.ts
⚠️ create() - Placeholder implementation
⚠️ update() - Stub function
⚠️ checkout() - Assignment logic incomplete
⚠️ checkin() - Return logic incomplete
✅ getAll() - Working with relations
✅ findById() - Complete with audit logs
✅ remove() - Working deletion
```

**Missing Business Logic**
- License seat allocation management
- Renewal date tracking and alerts
- Compliance monitoring
- Cost optimization features

**API Integration**
- No dedicated API routes for licenses
- Missing export functionality
- Limited bulk operations
