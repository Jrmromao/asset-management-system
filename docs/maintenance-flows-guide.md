# 🔄 Custom Maintenance Flows
## Automate Your Asset Management Like Never Before

> **Transform repetitive maintenance tasks into intelligent, automated workflows that save time, reduce errors, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.**

## 🎯 What Are Maintenance Flows?

Maintenance Flows are **intelligent automation rules** that trigger specific actions based on conditions you define. Think of them as your digital maintenance assistant that works 24/7, automatically handling routine tasks so your team can focus on what matters most.

### ✨ Why You'll Love Maintenance Flows

| **Before Flows** | **After Flows** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| ❌ Manual notifications | ✅ Automatic alerts to the right people |
| ❌ Forgotten follow-ups | ✅ Scheduled maintenance reminders |
| ❌ Inconsistent approvals | ✅ Standardized approval workflows |
| ❌ Scattered communication | ✅ Centralized, automated updates |
| ❌ Human errors | ✅ Reliable, consistent processes |

## 📊 Flow Analytics & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Track

#### **📈 Performance Indicators**
- **Success Rate** - % of flows completing successfully
- **Execution Count** - How often flows trigger
- **Time Savings** - Hours saved through automation
- **Error Reduction** - Decrease in manual mistakes

#### **🎯 Optimization Opportunities**
- Flows with low success rates need refinement
- Frequently triggered flows should be optimized
- Unused flows can be archived
- High-impact flows should be replicated

### Monthly Flow Review
